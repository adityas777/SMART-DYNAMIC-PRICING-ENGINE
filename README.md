## 🛠️ How to Run the App Locally

### 1. 📦 Install Requirements
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium shap scikit-learn streamlit-folium
2. ▶️ Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run smart_dynamic_pricing_app.py
🧾 Input Data Format
Your inventory CSV must contain these columns:

csv
Copy
Edit
Product_Name, State, Month, Sales_Volume, Stock_Quantity, Unit_Price, Expiration_Date, Inventory_Turnover_Rate
📌 If any column is missing, the app will ask you to correct it before continuing.

🗺️ Interactive State Selection (India)
The app uses a GeoJSON file of Indian states.

You can click any state on the map to automatically:

Filter Walmart stores in that state.

Show predictions for that region and selected month.

🔄 Workflow
User uploads inventory data

Selects a state by clicking the map

Picks a month from dropdown

App runs ML + RL to:

Predict price

Suggest discount

Simulate revenue, waste, demand

Recommend reorder if needed

All results shown via charts, KPIs, maps, and explainability visuals
